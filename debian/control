Description: C library for high-throughput sequencing data formats
 HTSlib is an implementation of a unified C library for accessing common file
 formats, such as SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map), CRAM and VCF (Variant Call
 Format), used for high-throughput sequencing data, and is the core library
 used by samtools and bcftools. HTSlib only depends on zlib. It is known to be
 compatible with gcc, g++ and clang.
 .
 HTSlib implements a generalized BAM (binary SAM) index, with file extension
 ‘csi’ (coordinate-sorted index). The HTSlib file reader first looks for the
 new index and then for the old if the new index is absent.

 This package contains development files for the HTSlib: headers, static
 library, manual pages, etc.
 .
 For compatibility with sambamba, the internal routine cram_to_bam was
 exported, hereto adopting a patch found in guix.

Description: generic indexer for TAB-delimited genome position files
 Tabix indexes files where some columns indicate sequence coordinates: name
 (usually a chromosome), start and stop. The input data file must be position
 sorted and compressed by bgzip (provided in this package), which has a gzip
 like interface. After indexing, tabix is able to quickly retrieve data lines by
 chromosomal coordinates. Fast data retrieval also works over network if an URI
 is given as a file name.
 .
 This version of tabix is built from the HTSlib source.
