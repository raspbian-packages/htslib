+HTSlib is an implementation of a unified C library for accessing common file
+formats, such as [SAM, CRAM and VCF][1], used for high-throughput sequencing
+data, and is the core library used by [samtools][2] and [bcftools][3].
+HTSlib only depends on [zlib][4].
+It is known to be compatible with gcc, g++ and clang.
+
+HTSlib implements a generalized BAM index, with file extension `.csi`
+(coordinate-sorted index). The HTSlib file reader first looks for the new index
+and then for the old if the new index is absent.
+
+This project also includes the popular tabix indexer, which indexes both `.tbi`
+and `.csi` formats, and the bgzip compression utility.
